## Normal encoder to Deep Neural Network decoder
Due to the relatively low statistical difference between L2 and L1, another valid approach could be input the L1 data preprocessed by taking the minute and hour mean values. We input the L1 data into the encoder that returns a hidden state that is later processed by a neural network.[Explanatory video]()
